                                refered to as "Porch Pirates" are very malignant and are very rarely caught. Only 10% of all package
                                theft cases are brougt to justice, which is astonishing thinking that over 100 million people suffer 
                                from this. Out of the whole population of the U.S., 60% know loved ones that have been deeply affected
                                by package theft, and the number just keeps growing each year. In the U.S, there are 327 milllion people, and
                                1/3 of the people suffer from package thert. That is unheard of.There are many devices that people use to prevent this
                                sort of theft to happen, but none of them seem to be useful because the numbers just keep rising. Porch Pirates can steal 
                                packages ranging from everyday utensils to advanced technology. According to reports in the U.S., most package theft 
                                cases occur in rural states such as virginia, or tennesse. Our product is directed toward people who live in rural area and order
